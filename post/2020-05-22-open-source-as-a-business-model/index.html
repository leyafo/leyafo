        <h1>Open source is a business model, not just free beer or software.</h1>
<p>Open souce is everywhere, but we were rarely paid for them. It is a problem at this: How to make money from an open source project? As we know, some of them are side projects, the others are full-time jobs.</p>
<p>If you have created a popular project like Redis or Nginx, people would know your work and your professional field. You can build a new service for your customers. While they building their products with your code, it will genreate new demands in your professional field, so that you are the best key-man to achieve these problems. Open source your code and let people use it free, is the best marketing strategy which doesen’t need too much money to spread.</p>
<p>Every programmer dreams of making software once and incoming forever, which like an application still running on a server. It’s impossible but businessese don't work like this. Business problems has constantly changing, we shoud adapt the reality not something we have enjoyed.</p>
<p>For example, if you invented a json parser, which is the fastest parser in the world. You want people to pay for this parser (monthly payment is better). Ask yourself these questions about it:</p>
<p>Why they must use your parser instead the others? <br />
When people have problems while using your software, what do you do? <br />
If json became unpopular, what’s your parser to be?<br />
Your parser is just a tool, why must pay it for monthly?<br />
How to obtain the new demands?</p>
<p>Business is not running like code. Suppose you want to make an APP that the same as Uber and it is running on a mobile app with GPS, online payments, fast wireless networks, and a powerful battery. Before ten years ago, you couldn’t build it, because these series of technology were not invented. We dubbed them ’Industry Chain’ and your code can just only adapte the one of them; You must fully understand what you’re doing and why it is so important. Your code is a gun and your business strategy is a compass. Open source your code to obtain the demands from the real world. It’s a good marketing strategy that the costing of distribution is zero.</p>
